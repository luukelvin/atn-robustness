# Air Traffic Network Robustness

Code and data used for the Math 168 final project entitled "What Happens When Airports Fail? Analyzing the Resilience of the Global Air Network" by Johan Chua, Farrel Gomargana, Seeun Lim, Kelvin Luu, Felix Su, and Ethan Tran.

## Description

The Kaggle dataset [1] that we used for this project is present in this repository under `kaggle_data`.

The `preliminary.ipynb` Python notebook explores the dataset and computes the centrality measures of the network representation we obtain from the data. It also does some preliminary examination and visualization of the network as nodes are removed according to closeness and betweenness centrality. The requirements to run this notebook are listed in `requirements_preliminary.txt`.
